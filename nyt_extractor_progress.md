# NYTimes Cooking Extractor Progress (as of June 2025)

## What We've Tried

- **Separate Extractor:** Created a NYTimesRecipeExtractor class, using a factory to select the right extractor based on the URL.
- **Browser Automation:** Used Selenium with a persistent Chrome profile to maintain login/session state, similar to Instagram.
- **Bypassing Login & Bot Detection:**
  - Implemented a login check and provided instructions for manual login if needed.
  - Added anti-bot-detection measures (user agent spoofing, disabling automation flags, etc.).
  - Disabled JavaScript at first, but re-enabled it after realizing NYTimes loads content dynamically.
- **Selector Strategies:**
  - Tried to extract ingredients and steps by:
    - Looking for headings like "Ingredients" and "Preparation."
    - Using various CSS selectors and XPaths for lists and containers.
    - Falling back to printing the main content area's HTML for debugging.
- **Debugging Output:**
  - Added server log printouts of the main content's HTML to help analyze the page structure and improve selectors.

## What We've Learned

- **Bot Detection:** NYTimes has strong bot detection, but with a persistent Chrome profile and careful options, we can bypass it and stay logged in.
- **Dynamic Content:** The actual recipe content (ingredients, steps) is loaded dynamically via JavaScript, so JavaScript must be enabled in Selenium.
- **Selector Challenges:** The "Ingredients" and "Preparation" sections are not always simple lists or may be deeply nested, possibly rendered by React components with custom attributes or structure.
- **Current Limitation:** Even with the right login and page load, our selectors haven't yet matched the real structure of the ingredients and steps. The debug HTML printout is the next step to analyze and update selectors, but this requires a bit more time and iteration.

## Next Steps (When You Resume)

1. **Review the Debug HTML:**
   - Use the printed HTML in the server log to identify the exact structure of the ingredients and steps.
   - Update the extractor's selectors to match the real NYTimes DOM.
2. **(Optional) Use Browser DevTools:**
   - If you want, open the recipe page in Chrome, inspect the "Ingredients" and "Preparation" sections, and note any unique `data-testid`, class names, or structure.
3. **Iterate:**
   - Test the updated selectors, and repeat as needed until extraction is reliable.

## The Good News

- The extractor is robust against login walls and bot detection.
- The architecture is clean and ready for more sites.
- Once the selectors are dialed in, NYTimes extraction should be as smooth as Instagram.
